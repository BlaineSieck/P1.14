**Sketch Design:**

**Main Functions:**

time, date, schedule/calendar, current weather, weekly weather, health app (sleep, running etc.), reminders/notifications, twitter feed, music controls, lighting controls, on/off switch

**Implementation:**

We have divided the functions among our group members to develop individually. We meet once a week to go over what we have accomplished, merge our functions, and make changes to the design when necessary. As of now, the mirror will begin in an off state (only displaying the date and time) and then once it is turned on all of the other functions will become visible and active. You will be able to drag and drop items to any of the 4 edges of the mirror as long as they do not overlap with each other.

**Future Plans:**  

We will continue to make adjustments where necessary as we begin merging our functions. We need to figure out a grid to snap objects to and determine acceptable states for the mirror in terms of which functions can be on at the same time.
